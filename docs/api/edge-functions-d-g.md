#### Features
- **Dual Query**: Separately fetches upcoming recordings and publications with appropriate date/status filters
- **Recording Filters**: Only includes bookings with status `conversation_started`, `booked`, or `in_progress` for recordings
- **Publication Filters**: Includes all bookings with upcoming `publish_date` regardless of status
- **Client Join**: Includes client name and email via join on `clients` table
- **Deduplication**: When type is `all`, deduplicates bookings that appear in both recording and publication queries
- **Type Annotation**: Each booking includes a `type` field ("recording" or "publication")
- **Configurable Window**: `days_ahead` controls how far into the future to look
- **Sorted**: Recordings sorted by `recording_date`, publications by `publish_date`

#### Example Request
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/get-upcoming-bookings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "days_ahead": 14,
    "type": "recordings"
  }'

## Error Handling

All functions implement consistent error handling with CORS support:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Detailed error message explaining what went wrong"
}
```

Common error scenarios:
- **400 Bad Request**: Missing required parameters
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid session tokens or missing API keys
- **404 Not Found**: Resources not found (clients, sheets, podcasts)
- **500 Internal Server Error**: API failures, database errors, or processing issues

## Environment Variables Required

Functions require the following environment variables to be configured:

- `SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Service role key for database access
- `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`: Google service account credentials for Sheets API
- `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_USER_EMAIL`: Email for domain-wide delegation
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Claude AI API key for content generation
- `PODSCAN_API_KEY`: Podscan API key for podcast data
- `EMAIL_BISON_API_TOKEN`: Email Bison API token for email operations

## Rate Limiting and Performance

- **Concurrent Processing**: Most functions use batch processing with controlled concurrency
- **Timeout Protection**: Functions implement early termination to avoid timeout limits
- **Caching Strategy**: Extensive use of central caching to minimize API calls
- **Cost Optimization**: Track and report API call savings and estimated cost reductions

## Usage Notes

1. **Authentication**: Functions use service-to-service authentication via environment variables
2. **CORS**: All functions support CORS for browser-based applications
3. **Caching**: Aggressive caching strategy significantly reduces API costs and improves performance
4. **Error Recovery**: Functions handle partial failures gracefully and provide detailed error information
5. **Scalability**: Designed to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently
