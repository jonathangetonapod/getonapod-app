/**
 * Buy credits back for a workspace that is running out, without a person.
 *
 * The columns for this — refill_threshold_credits and refill_pack_credits —
 * have been in the billing profile since it was created, with a constraint
 * requiring both or neither, and nothing ever read them. So an agency that had
 * asked for automatic top-ups still stopped dead at zero.
 *
 * This spends somebody's money while they are asleep, so every guard here is
 * deliberate:
 *
 *   * opt-in only, and off unless both columns are set
 *   * one refill per workspace per day, keyed in the ledger, so a stuck tick
 *     or a double schedule cannot bill twice
 *   * a saved card only; there is no path here that asks anyone for one
 *   * a failure is recorded and the workspace is left alone until tomorrow
 *
 * Granting is the webhook's job, not this function's. It charges and stops:
 * payment_intent.succeeded is what proves the money arrived, and inventing a
 * second grant path here would let credits exist for a payment that later
 * failed.
