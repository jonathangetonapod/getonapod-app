 * Looks at custom domains nobody is looking at.
 *
 * Every check the platform performed was a side effect of a platform admin
 * having the domains card open: the poll only ran while that page was
 * mounted, and only for domains still setting up. A domain that reached
 * serving was never checked again by anything. Certificates renew on their
 * own until the day they do not, and the first anyone would have known was an
 * agency's client meeting a browser warning on the agency's own address.
 *
 * Invoked by pg_cron via pg_net with a shared secret — no user JWT
 * (verify_jwt = false), the same shape as inbox-enroll-tick.
 *
 * The check itself is the one the button runs. A second implementation here
 * would drift from it, and the drift would be invisible precisely because
 * nobody watches this path.
