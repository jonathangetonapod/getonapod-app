 * The way out.

 * There was none: an owner who wanted to close their account had to email, and
 * the subscription kept charging until somebody cancelled it by hand.
 *
 * Two things about this are worth knowing before pressing it, so both are said
 * on the screen rather than in a help article. The subscription ends now, not
 * at the end of the period — the workspace stops working the moment this
 * returns, so billing the rest of the month would be for nothing. And access
 * goes with it, including this session, which is why there is no undo button
 * here afterwards: by then you cannot sign in to press it.
